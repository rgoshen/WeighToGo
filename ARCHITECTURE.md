# Architecture

This file is a 30-second orientation. The **authoritative architecture
specification** for the web rebuild is [SRS §4 — Architecture](docs/specs/WeighToGo_Web_SRS_v2.md#4-architecture).
When this file and the SRS disagree, the SRS wins.

## Two stacks, one repository

WeighToGo is a polyglot monorepo:

## Web rebuild — three-pattern backend

The backend at `web/backend/src/weighttogo/` combines three patterns. Each
pattern owns a distinct concern; together they make the dependency direction
visible and enforceable.

| Pattern | Concern | Where it shows up |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Screaming Architecture** | Folder structure that "screams" the domain | Top-level packages named after bounded contexts (`auth/`, `weight_tracking/`, `goals/`, `achievements/`, `audit/`) rather than after frameworks |
| **Clean Architecture** | Dependency rule — outer layers depend on inner | `domain/` has zero framework imports; `application/` depends on `domain/`; `infrastructure/` depends on both |
| **Hexagonal Architecture** | Ports and adapters | Domain defines a `Port` (interface); infrastructure provides an `Adapter` (concrete impl wrapping FastAPI / SQLAlchemy / bcrypt) |

The dependency rule is enforced in CI by `import-linter` — domain code that
imports a framework breaks the build.

## Web rebuild — frontend

The frontend at `web/frontend/src/` mirrors the backend bounded contexts. Server
state is managed by TanStack Query (no ad-hoc `useEffect` fetches), forms by
React Hook Form + Zod, UI by Material UI v9, routing by React Router 6.

Decision context: [ADR-0014 — TanStack Query for Server State](docs/adr/0014-tanstack-query-for-server-state.md).
