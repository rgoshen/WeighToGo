## Phase 3 — Web Scaffold (2026-05-22)

**What was done**

- Stood up runnable but otherwise empty frontend and backend skeletons
  for the web rebuild, so that later feature phases inherit a complete
  toolchain. Tracked as issue #9, the third phase of Milestone Two.
- Scaffolded the backend under `web/backend/`: a uv-managed FastAPI
  project using a `src/weighttogo/` package layout, with ruff, mypy in
  strict mode, and pytest configured. Added an environment-driven
  settings module, a `GET /health` endpoint reporting service status
  and the active environment, an Alembic migration harness (no
  migrations authored yet), and a Docker Compose definition for a local
  PostgreSQL 16 database.
- Scaffolded the frontend under `web/frontend/`: a Vite project using
  React 19 and TypeScript in strict mode, with ESLint and Prettier,
  Vitest and React Testing Library, and Playwright for end-to-end
  tests. Added the Material UI theme carrying the design-system teal
  palette and a root application component mounted through the theme
  provider.
- Added a single pre-commit hook manager covering both stacks, and four
  path-filtered GitHub Actions workflows: backend CI, frontend CI,
  end-to-end tests, and a daily dependency security audit.
- Updated the repository README with an accurate web-application status
  and quickstart instructions for both stacks.

**How it was done**

- Branched `feature/m2-phase-3-web-scaffold` from `main` and worked in
  sixteen small, atomic commits, one per subtask.
- The three units with genuine behavior — the backend settings module,
  the `/health` endpoint, and the frontend theme and application
  component — were developed test-first on a red-green cycle.
  Configuration, which has no behavior to assert, was verified by
  running its tools: ruff, mypy, tsc, eslint, prettier, the two dev
  servers, the database container, and the Alembic harness.
- Two decisions shaped the scaffold: the `/health` endpoint was kept
  minimal (status and environment only), with the fuller health check
  deferred until the database session layer exists; and a single
  pre-commit framework runs both stacks' linters, because Git exposes
  only one pre-commit slot and two hook managers would conflict.
- Both stacks were verified end to end: the backend dev server serves
  `/health`, the PostgreSQL container reports healthy, and Alembic
  applies cleanly against it; the frontend builds, unit tests pass, and
  a Playwright run drives the application in a real browser.

**Issues encountered**

- The Playwright end-to-end test surfaced a runtime failure that the
  unit tests had not: the Material UI theme provider received a second
  React instance because the development bundler split React across
  separate pre-bundles. It was resolved by pre-bundling React, the
  styling library, and Material UI together and deduplicating React in
  the bundler configuration.
- The frontend linting, test, and UI-library dependencies were briefly
  installed into a stray package manifest at the repository root rather
  than under `web/frontend/`, leaving them undeclared in the frontend
  manifest. The error was caught before the work shipped; the stray
  root files were removed and every dependency consolidated into
  `web/frontend/`, verified with a clean install from the lockfile.

**Documentation**

- The README web-application section was rewritten from a placeholder
  note into an accurate status with backend and frontend quickstarts.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` was reviewed and remains accurate for the Android
  workflow; it does not yet cover web-stack development or the
  pre-commit hooks, which are recommended for a later documentation
  pass.

**Reviews**

- Three review passes — code, adversarial, and security — were run on
  the branch before the merge gate.
- The code and adversarial reviews both flagged that the backend pinned
  Python 3.13 while the project targets 3.12; the pin was corrected to
  3.12 so the declared minimum is the version actually run. The
  adversarial review confirmed the scaffold is architecture-neutral —
  it introduces no organize-by-technical-layer folders and does not
  pre-empt the later domain-architecture phase. A clarifying comment
  was added to the Vite config explaining why React, the styling
  library, and Material UI are pre-bundled together.
- The security review found no committed secrets, no workflow
  script-injection, and least-privilege workflow permissions. Its one
  recommendation — pinning third-party CI actions to commit SHAs — is
  noted as future repository-wide hardening, deferred for consistency
  with the existing Android workflow.
- A naming inconsistency the reviews raised — the database identifier
  `weightogo` versus the Python package `weighttogo` — was resolved by
  standardizing the web project on `weighttogo`. The database
  identifiers, the `.env.example`, the Docker Compose definition, and
  the SRS examples were all updated to match. The preserved Android
  artifact keeps its own `weightogo` package and is unaffected.

## Phase 2 Follow-up — Documentation Hygiene (2026-05-22)

**What was done**

- Cleared repository-wide documentation debt that the Phase 2
  documentation sweep surfaced and that was deliberately scoped out of
  the restructure pull request (#19) to keep that change focused.
  Tracked as issue #20; with this work merged, Phase 2 is complete.
- Removed every live AI-tool reference from committed documentation: a
  tooling-attribution line in the Android code quality audit, two
  references in the Milestone Two brief, an attribution and a local
  tool-config path in the Phase 7 SMS testing guide, a local
  tool-config path in the Phase 8 manual test scenarios, and an aside
  in the SRS introduction.
- Removed every citation of the root project instruction file from
  other documentation: three reference-table rows and a constraints
  paragraph in the Milestone Two brief, roughly two dozen citations in
  the Android code quality fix plan (violation labels, workflow
  references, and example-commit-message footers), and one in the
  manual testing checklist.
- Repaired corrupted shell commands across three testing documents
  (two manual-testing command guides and the testing-directory
  README). A botched find/replace had merged the Android application
  package token into adjacent words, dropped a path separator, and —
  in one guide — left a misspelled package name and a wrong database
  filename. Restructure-induced build, source, and data paths were
  corrected, and a post-restructure path note was added to each
  repaired guide.
- Corrected retired-tracker references (`TODO.md`,
  `project_summary.md`) in the actively-maintained testing-directory
  README, while leaving such references intact in frozen historical
  material where they accurately record the project's state at the
  time of writing.
- Replaced a `v2.x` milestone-release version scheme with honest
  `0.x` development versioning across the SRS and the Milestone Two
  brief, since the web application is in initial, pre-1.0 development.
- Delivered as PR #21, branch `docs/m2-phase-2-doc-hygiene`.

**How it was done**

- Branched `docs/m2-phase-2-doc-hygiene` from the latest `main` after
  the Phase 2 restructure pull request merged.
- A read-and-verify documentation sweep opened every in-scope document
  in full; repository-wide searches then confirmed that issue #20's
  diagnosis of AI-tool and instruction-file references was complete.
- The repository owner chose, per file, to repair the corrupted
  command guides in place rather than archive or delete them. Ground
  truth for the repair — application package, Gradle module name,
  launcher activity, and database filename — was read directly from
  the Android sources.
- The corrupted commands were repaired with a scripted, systematic
  pass and then verified line by line.
- The retired-tracker policy was applied by classification: frozen
  historical documents keep their references as accurate history;
  actively-maintained documents have them corrected.
- Work was committed as a sequence of small, atomic commits, one per
  debt category.
- Three review passes — code, adversarial, and security — were run on
  the branch; their findings are recorded below.

**Issues encountered**

- The read-and-verify sweep found one AI-tooling reference in the SRS
  introduction that issue #20's original diagnosis had not listed.
- The corruption in the testing commands was more systematic than
  stale paths: a find/replace had merged shell tokens, dropped a path
  separator, misspelled the package name, and used the wrong database
  filename.
- The adversarial review found a third corrupted snippet — in the
  testing-directory README — and one restructure-stale path that the
  first repair pass had missed.
- The adversarial review also flagged the same wrong package and
  database names in a test-helper script outside this issue's
  documentation scope.

**How issues were resolved**

- The additional SRS reference was surfaced to the repository owner,
  who chose to remove it; it was removed alongside the other AI-tool
  references.
- The corrupted commands were repaired against ground truth from the
  Android sources and verified to contain no residual corruption.
- The third corrupted snippet and the stale path from the adversarial
  review were repaired the same way in follow-up commits and
  re-verified.
- The out-of-scope script defect was surfaced to the repository owner
  as a separate decision rather than folded into this issue.

## Phase 2 — Repository Restructure (2026-05-21)

**What was done**

- Restructured the repository from an Android-only layout into a polyglot
  monorepo: the entire Android Gradle project moved from the repository root
  into `android/`, and `web/frontend/` and `web/backend/` were created as
  tracked placeholders for the web rebuild.
- Tagged `v1.0.0-android` on the final pre-restructure commit of `main`,
  marking the end of the Android-only era. The restructure commit itself is not
  separately tagged — it is a structural change, not a release.
- Updated the Android CI workflow to build from `android/`, corrected its
  report and artifact paths, and path-filtered its triggers so it runs only for
  Android changes.
- Extended `.gitignore` with Python and Node sections ahead of the web stack.
- Added ADR-0007 (rebuild as a full-stack web application) and ADR-0008
  (polyglot monorepo); renumbered the SRS ADR index and every in-text ADR
  reference to the seven-ADR M2 set.
- Rewrote the root `README.md` around the monorepo layout and the mobile-to-web
  narrative, resolving the two pre-existing `README.md` defects flagged in
  Phase 1 — the broken `TODO.md` links and the stale project-structure tree.
- Pointed the CONTRIBUTING Android setup instructions at the new `android/`
  path.
- Delivered as PR #19, branch `feature/m2-phase-2-repo-restructure`.

**How it was done**

- Branched `feature/m2-phase-2-repo-restructure` from the latest `main`.
- Every Android file was relocated with `git mv` so the move is recorded as a
  set of pure renames; `git log --follow` confirmed that history, blame, and
  log all trace through the move.
- The relocated Android build was verified before any further change:
  `./gradlew test`, `lint`, and `assembleDebug` all pass at the new path with
  no source modifications.
- The work was committed as a sequence of small, atomic commits — the move, the
  CI change, the web scaffold, the ignore rules, the ADRs, the SRS renumber,
  and the documentation updates each as their own commit.
- A documentation sweep was run as the pre-push gate, updating the README,
  CONTRIBUTING, the SRS, and this log.
- Three review passes — code, adversarial, and security — were run on PR #19;
  their findings are recorded below.

**Issues encountered**

- `local.properties` was listed for relocation but is machine-specific and
  git-ignored, so it could not be moved with `git mv`.
- The Android CI workflow's report and artifact paths referred to a module
  named `app`, but the actual module is `weightogo` — a stale reference that
  predated this phase.
- The SRS carried two ADR cross-references that pointed at the wrong ADR
  independently of the renumbering.
- A thorough documentation sweep surfaced pre-existing documentation debt wider
  than this phase's scope: corrupted command snippets in `docs/testing/`, live
  AI-tool references and project-instruction-file citations in several committed
  documents, and retired tracker references.
- The review passes flagged three documentation and configuration gaps: the
  expanded `.gitignore` did not ignore `.env` files; the README
  repository-layout tree omitted several directories; and the SRS ADR-index
  subsection was still headed "Planned" although two of its ADRs are now
  written.

**How issues were resolved**

- `local.properties` was excluded from the tracked move and copied into
  `android/` instead, where the existing ignore rule still covers it; the
  Android build locates the SDK correctly at the new path.
- The CI paths were corrected to `android/weightogo/build/...` in the same
  change that repointed the workflow at the new directory, fixing the stale
  module name and the new path layer together.
- The two mis-targeted SRS references were corrected to their proper ADRs while
  the index was renumbered, leaving the SRS internally consistent.
- That debt predates this phase. It is tracked as Phase 2 follow-on work in
  issue #20 — a dedicated documentation-hygiene pass delivered as its own pull
  request — rather than expanding the restructure PR.
- The three review findings were resolved on the PR: an `.env` ignore rule was
  added (with `.env.example` kept tracked), the README layout tree was
  completed, and the SRS subsection heading was corrected. The security pass
  found no vulnerabilities.

## Phase 1 — Tracking Log Scaffold (2026-05-21)

**What was done**

- Added this `SUMMARY.md` file at the repository root: the durable,
  reverse-chronological narrative log for the milestone, with the newest entry
  prepended at the top.
- Seeded the log with two entries — this Phase 1 entry and the Phase 0 entry
  below it — so the record is complete from the start of the milestone.
- Delivered as PR #18, branch `docs/m2-phase-1-summary-scaffold`.

**How it was done**

- Branched `docs/m2-phase-1-summary-scaffold` from the latest `main`.
- The Phase 0 entry was carried forward from the breakdown prepared at the close
  of Phase 0 and recorded on the Phase 1 tracking issue (#7), then verified
  against the merged Phase 0 pull request before inclusion; no changes were
  needed.
- The file was checked through the GitHub Markdown renderer to confirm both
  entries display correctly.
- A documentation sweep was run as the pre-push gate. It confirmed `SUMMARY.md`
  is the only document this phase needs to add or change. The sweep also noted
  pre-existing staleness in the root `README.md` — a project-structure tree
  predating the repository restructure, and two links to the retired `TODO.md`
  task tracker — which is out of scope for this phase and is left for the README
  revisions scheduled in the repository-restructure phase (Phase 2) and the
  documentation-closeout phase (Phase 9).
- Three review passes — code, adversarial, and security — were run on PR #18.

**Issues encountered**

- None arose in this phase's own work: adding a single documentation file raised
  no blocker or defect, and there is no application code, test, or build impact.
  The documentation sweep's observation about pre-existing `README.md` staleness,
  noted above under "How it was done", is a deferred out-of-scope item rather
  than an issue in this phase.

**How issues were resolved**

- Not applicable.

## Phase 0 — Repository & Project Setup (2026-05-21)

**What was done**

- Renamed the working repository on GitHub: `rgoshen-snhu/cs360-WeightToGoMobile`
  → `rgoshen-snhu/WeighToGo`; updated the local `snhu` remote and the `gh`
  default repo.
- Stood up GitHub project tracking: a Project board ("WeighToGo — CS 499
  Capstone"), four epic issues (M2 #2, M3 #3, M4 #4, Final #5), and ten M2 phase
  issues (Phases 0–9, issues #6–#15) attached as sub-issues of the M2 epic.
- Updated old repository-name references in the SRS, README, and CONTRIBUTING;
  fixed a broken CI badge and placeholder repository URLs.
- Added a `## Tasks` section to the issue templates; relocated the Android
  development journal to `docs/history/android_summary.md` and documented the
  new directory with a README.
- Removed two unused legacy GitHub Actions workflows left from an earlier
  integration setup.
- Delivered as PR #16, branch `chore/m2-phase-0-repo-project-setup`.

**How it was done**

- Repository renamed with `gh repo rename`; GitHub's automatic old-URL redirect
  verified (HTTP 301).
- Board, epics, and phase issues created with the `gh` CLI; phase issues linked
  as sub-issues via the GitHub sub-issue API; all issues added to the board.
- Documentation edits were surgical — only repository-name references were
  changed; historical mentions in the SRS naming-considerations narrative were
  deliberately preserved.
- The core change was committed as two atomic commits (`chore:` templates +
  journal relocation, `docs:` repo-name updates), with follow-up commits for
  review findings and owner-directed changes.
- Three review passes — code, adversarial, and security — were run on PR #16.

**Issues encountered**

- The `gh` token lacked the `project` OAuth scope, blocking Project board
  creation.
- The journal relocation broke a relative link in `docs/testing/README.md`
  (review finding W1).
- Two unused legacy GitHub Actions workflows were present; the automated review
  workflow failed on every pull request for lack of a configured token secret.
- The newly created `docs/history/` directory was initially undocumented
  (adversarial review note N1).
- Phase 0 expanded beyond the original plan during execution, at the repository
  owner's direction.

**How issues were resolved**

- The owner refreshed the `gh` token with the `project` scope.
- W1 was fixed during the phase — the link was repointed to
  `../history/android_summary.md`.
- The two legacy workflows were removed (owner-directed) after verifying they
  had no branch-protection or file dependencies.
- A README was added for `docs/history/`, resolving N1.
- Broader `docs/` indexing was captured as a separate tracked issue (#17) under
  the M2 epic rather than expanding Phase 0 further.
