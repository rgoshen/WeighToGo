# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This is the decision log for architecture-level choices made across both the
Android artifact and the CS 499 web rebuild. Each row links to the full record.

Status values: **Accepted**, **Proposed**, **Deprecated**, **Superseded**.
When a record is superseded, both the old and new entries remain in the log —
the old one keeps its number and is marked accordingly.

New ADRs follow the structure shown by existing records in this folder and use
the next available number.
