"""Weekly rate-of-change algorithm for the weight_tracking bounded context.

Pure function — zero framework imports.  One of the CS 499 Milestone Three
algorithmic showcases.

The weekly rate of change is the difference between the moving average of the
most-recent 7-day window and the moving average of the immediately-prior 7-day
window.  Because the two windows are one week apart, that difference is already
expressed per week.

Time complexity:  O(w) over the entries that fall inside the two 7-day windows,
after the two indexed seeks performed by the caller's repository (ADR-0021).
Space complexity: O(1) — only running sums and counts are retained.
