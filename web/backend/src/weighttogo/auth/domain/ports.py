"""Repository port interfaces for the authentication domain.

Ports (interfaces) are defined in the domain layer. Infrastructure adapters
implement them. Use cases depend only on these abstractions — never on
SQLAlchemy, psycopg, or any persistence detail.

Following the Hexagonal Architecture pattern (SRS §4.2.3, ADR-0012), the
domain knows *what* it needs from persistence but never *how* it is provided.
