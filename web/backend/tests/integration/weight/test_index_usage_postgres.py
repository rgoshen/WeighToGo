"""NFR-P-3: weight-history reads use composite indexes on PostgreSQL.

Runs only when ``WEIGHTTOGO_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`` is set. CI provides a Postgres
service; locally run ``docker compose up -d postgres`` and export the DSN. The
partial ``WHERE is_deleted = FALSE`` indexes only materialize on PostgreSQL, so
this is the one test that validates NFR-P-3 against the production engine.

This module tests BOTH sets of indexes:
- Migration 0002: (user_id, observation_date DESC, entry_id DESC) — validated
  by ``test_list_query_uses_index_not_seqscan``
- Migration 0007: (user_id, created_at DESC) — validated by
  ``test_created_at_index_used_for_created_at_ordered_query``
